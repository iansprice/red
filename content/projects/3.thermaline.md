_Joining Thermaline as their first-ever technical hire, I stepped into a company with decades of history but
untapped digital potential. Little did I know that the systems I would create would fundamentally reshape how the
business operated._

## How to hand power to your customers

I designed a custom CMS that brought together complex technical tools with rich product content, creating a seamless
user experience. This system integrated interactive 360-degree views of sample equipment, dynamic configurators, and
detailed product informationâ€” **all feeding directly into our internal quoting tool**. QuickQuote then generated
precise technical specifications and automated CAD drawings, streamlining the path from exploration to engineering.

## Engineering and design, on-demand

### BeerCalc, MilkCalc, TubeDesigner ...

Perhaps the most visible impact came from developing our engineer-to-order e-commerce systems - **the first of their kind
in our industry**. Rather than simply digitizing existing processes, we created something entirely new that opened
additional revenue streams.

Automated technical drawings, pre-engineered units with minimal assembly needed, and simple yet industry-specialized
tools drove these improvements. 

All this user activity presented as an engaging e-commerce experience and fed directly into **Bigfoot**.

## Bigfoot

### A comprehensive internal platform

Bigfoot wasn't just another software project; it was **a complete reimagining of workflows** that had been established for
decades in a respected manufacturing organization.

Bigfoot combined manufacturing resource planning, sales tracking, custom engineering software,
work-floor task management, job tracking, and automated technical drawings.

Bigfoot **drove lean practices and streamlined processes** across all of Thermaline.

The results spoke for themselves: order-to-ship times dropped by 80% and profitability multiplied.
The effects were massive; The roles of our engineers shifted to R&D, enabling new product lines, and our increases in
reliability and profitability **reached all of our employees** through profit-sharing and high morale.

## Engineering the Future

Beyond the business systems, I found particular satisfaction in creating specialized engineering and quoting tools.
Developing technical drawing generators and fluid dynamics engines might sound dry on paper, but they became the
invisible foundation for R&D breakthroughs and new product development.

These tools translated complex engineering concepts into practical applications that could then be handed to our 
distributors, **multiplying the power of our engineering team at no cost**.
