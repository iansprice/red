_Starting as a lab project at Stanford University, AquaSeca's acoustic sensor technology was developed into a flow 
detection and stagnation monitoring system that could **track plumbing activity across multiple
points-of-use with a single, non-intrusive sensor**._

As part of the founding team, I created the technical backbone for our AI-driven water monitoring solution. This meant
**turning a technical experiment into a truly immersive, useful platform** for specialized professionals while 
establishing libraries, coding practices, and product design principles that could evolve with our company.
Our platform enabled new levels of insight while keeping the user experience straightforward,
allowing facilities staff to perform ongoing feedback to strengthen their own models while uncovering new trends.

**My role extended far beyond programming**. I trained clients, conducted UX research, represented our company at key
events, and performed on-site installations. The auto-documenting APIs I designed facilitated a dozen
integrations into third party platforms, expanding our product's reach. AquaSeca was deployed to hospitals and other 
facilities with critical sanitation and monitoring needs.

*AquaSeca was acquired by Alert Labs in 2024.*
