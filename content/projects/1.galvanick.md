Galvanick is a next-generation threat monitoring platform design for operational technology environments.

Joining during seed stage, I have led front-end, API, database, and product development. 

While this platform is proprietary, I can share my efforts taking Galvanick to market included building a new company 
site. 

------------

A radical re-branding of the company's image and public presentation, 
Galvanick's company site was designed for non-technical staff to focus on content alone.

**Features**:

- Custom, headless content management system
- Dynamic, configurable form generation and validation
- Dark/Light themes
